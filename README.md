### Leveraging neural networks and edge detection for better UAV localization 🚁🗺️📍
Official implementation for the paper "Leveraging neural networks and edge detection for better UAV localization".

Paper accepted to IGARSS 2024 : [arXiv submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06207)

## Method Overview

Offline, the edges of the RGB reference images are extracted to generate single-channel images. An AutoEncoder is then trained on these images for a task of pixel-by-pixel reconstruction. Subsequently, positions, embeddings, and the frozen encoder are transferred onto the drone.

Online, the drone's view is captured through a camera positioned beneath it. The outlines of the RGB image are then extracted and forwarded to the encoder, which generates an embedding. This embedding is subsequently compared, using cosine similarity, to all embeddings derived from the reference images. The drone's position is then inferred based on the position of the reference image with the highest similarity score.
